        2. Created a brief (2 paragraph max.) rationale for organizing the system in the way that you have. In particular, what are the advantages and disadvantages for both initial implementation and on-going maintenance / upgrades to a system that uses the design.
        
    *V1.0-Initial
        1. Created a draft using the provided design document format the captures your initial design sketch, and provided example application (Thermometer) as a guide.
        
    *V1.0-Skeleton
        1. The Java implementation, get the construction (coding) process underway as a means of verifiying our initial design.
